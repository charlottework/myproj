    <h3>My Passions...</h3>

    <p>
        - Travelling: I have been lucky enough to travel to many places in my life and have always found it exciting to learn about new cultures and people.
        <br> 
        I had the opportunity to go on an Erasmus course in Estonia, to spend 3 months in Canada and to visit other countries for tourism.
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>
        - Sport: I find that sport is a real source of motivation that allows me to do other things afterwards.
        <br>
        I particularly like running and skiing.
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>
        - Reading: I have recently started reading again but I find a way to relax and unwind at the end of the day. 
        <br>
        I particularly enjoy reading fantasy novels.
